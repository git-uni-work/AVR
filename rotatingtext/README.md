# " ROTATING TEXT "

-   Display a text stored in the **program memory**
-   The text should be **longer than 7 characters**
-   The text will be **rotating** from the left to the right
-   At the beginning, the display will be empty. Then the text will "arrive" (i.e., it wonâ€™t be displayed at once). At the end, the display will be empty again. This will be run repeatedly
-   The display size should be **customizable** (adjustable by a parameter), from 4 to 7 characters. This parameter should also be stored in the program memory
-   The program must be able to display any string of any (reasonable) size. The string will be **zero-terminated**

Here is an example of a text and display length definition:

    .cseg               ; data memory
    .org 0x100          ; starting from address 0x100

    my_text1:   .db "I want some points from this assignment", 0    ; zero-terminated string
    disp_len:   .db 5                                               ; the display length is 5

-   Since the text should be rotating, some **movement** in time is involved. The AVR CPU is clocked at **2 MHz**. You will need to use **waiting loops**
-   You will need to compute the length of the waiting loop, so that the movement will be visible. Assume that one AVR instruction takes one clock cycle
-   The waiting loop should be implemented as a **subroutine**. Hint: the call of the waiting loop could be **commented out** for debugging purposes.
